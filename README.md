# Employee-Tracker

Created a program that takes in information from a mysql database and displays said information in a node.js interface.  The mysql database contains 3 tables of information by employee, role, and department.  The node interface utilizes inquirer to bring up a multiple choice prompt to select specific information from the database as well as to let the user update/add new employees, departments, roles.

Make sure to npm install or delete the .gitignore.
